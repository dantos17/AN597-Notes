Tidy data satisfies three conditions: 1- each variable forms a column; 2- each observation forms a row; 3- ecah type of observational unit forms a table (so basically it's the type of data table that I've known for 10 years)

Examples of "messy data":
```{r}
library(tidyr)
students #first example, variables are all kinds of messed up
gather(students, sex, count, -grade) #now each row represents one observation with a unique combination of the variables
students2 #multiple variables are stored in one column
res <- gather(students2, sex_class, count, -grade)
res
separate(data= res, col= sex_class, c("sex", "class")) #we did it in two steps but you can also use chaining
```
