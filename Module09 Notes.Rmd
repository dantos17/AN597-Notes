We're talking about statistical inference and hypothesis testing

**critical value** corresponds to the quantile limits of interest; +/- 1-(alpha/2)
```{r}
n <- 1000
mu <- 3.5
sigma <- 4
v <- rnorm(n, mu, sigma)
s <- sample(v, size = 30, replace = FALSE)
s
m <- mean(s)
m
sd <- sd(s)
sd
sem <- sd(s)/sqrt(length(S))
sem
lower <- m- qnorm(1-0.05/2)*sem
upper <- m+ qnorm(1-0.05/2)*sem
ci<- c(lower, upper)
ci
```

**Central Limit Theorem**= distribution of averages and independent & identically distributed (iid) random variables becomes normal as the sample size increases. Allows us to have a good sense of the mean and distribution of average events in a population
