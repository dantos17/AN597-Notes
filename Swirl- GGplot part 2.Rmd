ggplot part 2, focusing on the fundamental components of the package to be better able to customise plots. We're also going over the second workhorse function **ggplot**.

There are 7 main components of ggplot2 plots:
-data frame: holds the data to be plotted
-aesthetic mapping: how data are mapped to color, size, etc.
-geoms: what we see in the plots; lines, points, etc. 
-facets: panels used in conditional plots
-stats: statistical transformations like binning, quantiles, etc.
-scales: cording that the aesthetic map uses
-coordinate system: how the plots are depicted
the last three are taken care of automatically in qplot

```{r}
qplot(displ, hwy, data= mpg, geom= c("point", "smooth"), facets= .~drv) #recap on how to use qplot
g <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ,hwy))
summary(g)
g+geom_point()
g+geom_point()+geom_smooth() #adds trendline and confidence band
```
